## Problem Statement

A significant portion of India’s workforce—including artisans, industrial workers, gig workers, and students from rural and semi-urban backgrounds—faces irregular schedules, high stress, poor sleep habits, and imbalanced daily routines. These lifestyle challenges directly affect individual well-being, productivity, and livelihood sustainability.

Most existing lifestyle and wellness solutions are either medical in nature, require extensive data collection, or are too complex for common users with limited digital literacy. There is a clear gap for a **simple, smart, non-medical, and accessible technology-based tool** that enables individuals to self-reflect on their daily habits and receive practical guidance without fear, diagnosis, or long onboarding processes.

Such a solution is particularly relevant in community-driven environments like NSS camps, educational institutions, and worker welfare programs, where awareness and preventive lifestyle guidance can create meaningful social impact.

## Proposed Idea

The proposed project is a **Smart AI-Based Lifestyle Self-Assessment Tool** designed to support workers, artisans, and students by helping them understand and improve their daily routines.

The system operates as a **chat-based web application** that asks exactly **10 simple, non-medical lifestyle questions**, one at a time, covering essential areas such as sleep, physical activity, diet, hydration, stress, screen time, work–life balance, and social interaction. The conversational design ensures minimal effort is required from users, making it suitable for individuals with varying levels of digital literacy.

Using **Generative AI (Google Gemini API)** as the core intelligence layer, the system analyzes user responses and generates a **structured lifestyle report** highlighting positive habits, potential risk areas, and realistic improvement suggestions. The solution does not store personal data, ensuring privacy and ethical usage.

This project aligns with the NSS themes of **Artisans, Industries and Livelihood** and **Basic Amenities**, as it focuses on improving daily well-being, awareness, and productivity through smart technology.
